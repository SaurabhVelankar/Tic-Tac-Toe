# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in C++ using the Windows generic app and Windows API.
This was made a practice project to improve my understaning of UI, game making, and APIs.
Some features of  the project:
  1] Has a new game feature so that players can start a new game.
  2] Has a welcoming, minimalistic design with attractive icons.
  3] Uses a point and click system for ease of use and player convenience.
